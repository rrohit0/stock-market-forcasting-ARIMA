# Stock Market Forecasting using ARIMA & Time Series Analysis

## Overview
This project applies ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Time Series Analysis (TSA) to forecast stock market trends. The notebook explores historical stock price data, preprocesses it, and builds a predictive model using ARIMA to generate future price forecasts.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:
[Price Volume Data for All US Stocks & ETFs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs)

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, normalizes stock prices, and extracts relevant time-series features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes stock trends, moving averages, and seasonality patterns.
- **ARIMA Model:** Implements an ARIMA model to analyze time series data and forecast future stock prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compares actual vs predicted values using performance metrics like RMSE and AIC.
- **Visualization:** Uses matplotlib and seaborn for graphical representation of trends and forecast results.

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and select the required stock for analysis.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand trends and seasonality.
3. Train an ARIMA model with optimal parameters for better forecasting accuracy.
4. Evaluate the model using statistical measures and visualize the predictions.

## Results
- The model effectively predicts short-term stock price trends.
- Forecasts are visualized using time-series plots for better interpretation.
- The accuracy depends on market volatility and the choice of ARIMA parameters.
